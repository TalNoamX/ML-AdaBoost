# Machine Learning algorithms

**AdaBoost:** short for Adaptive Boosting, is a machine learning meta-algorithm.
implemention of Adaboost with Python.
Use of a hypothesis created with a rectangle and a circle that classifies points inside and out of convex.
used the HC Temperature data set.

**KNN:** k-nearest neighbors algorithm. implemention of knn with Python, and use the same.
used the HC Temperature data set.


**the HC Temperature data set**, a collection of points that consists of three parameters: 
1.body heat 
2.sex 
3.height
of 65 men and 65 women.
